# 🐍 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** journey!  
This repo contains all my daily projects from the [Udemy course by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/), where I’ll build 100 Python projects in 100 days — covering everything from **beginner to professional-level Python development**.

## 🏆 Overview

> “Discipline is choosing between what you want now and what you want most.”

I’m committing to code every day for 100 days — building, learning, and sharing my progress.  
Follow along to see my progress from simple Python scripts to full-scale apps and data projects.
